I wanted to do something whit java and this was the first somewhat useful thing that came to mind.<br>
_ps: the idea is from a friend_

  - build and tested whit java-21

```

### option:
-p: start playing immediately
### MUSIC DIRECTORY

## Future plans
I consider this music player as done, and so there a no plans for more features.<br>
